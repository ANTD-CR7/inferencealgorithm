# User-Centered Design (UCD)

This project is explicitly designed around **User-Centered Design (UCD)** principles, prioritizing clarity, accessibility, and interaction over raw technical complexity. The goal is not just to compute Bayesian inference, but to make it **understandable and usable** for real users.

## How UCD Is Emphasized
- **Direct interaction over forms**: users set evidence by clicking nodes, not typing variables.
- **Immediate feedback**: results update right after inference runs, reinforcing learning.
- **Guided discovery**: hints and legends explain how to interact without a manual.
- **Error prevention**: query nodes are visually highlighted to prevent invalid evidence.
- **Progressive complexity**: advanced comparisons are optional, not forced.
- **Responsive design**: layout, spacing, and visuals are tuned for mobile usability.

## Why It Matters
Without UCD, a Bayesian inference tool becomes intimidating or confusing. This system makes the same computations **approachable**, ensuring users can explore networks, test hypotheses, and learn through interaction.
